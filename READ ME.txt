# Simple Chatbot Project Using GPT-4

## Overview
This repository contains the Simple Chatbot Project, an advanced chatbot application powered by OpenAI's GPT-4. The project is split into two distinct versions:
1. **Chatbot without Memory**: This version of the chatbot handles each query independently, without retaining information from previous interactions.
2. **Chatbot with Memory**: This enhanced version maintains a contextual memory across interactions, allowing for more coherent and context-aware conversations.

## Features
- **GPT-4 Integration**: Leverages the powerful language understanding capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4.
- **Contextual Memory**: (In the memory-enabled version) Remembers the context of the conversation for more natural interactions.
- **Easy-to-use Interface**: Designed to be straightforward and user-friendly.
